Develop and implement an IE application that is able to extract from conference workshop call for papers (CFP) relevant information. You should be able to extract the following information from such a document:

* Name of Workshop
* Acronym of Workshop
* Date of Workshop
* Location of Workshop
* Name of Conference
* Acronym of Conference
* Paper Submission Date (of Workshop)

The output shall be XML based (on a schema defined by yourself according to the definition of the task), plain text, or HTML.

You may use the GATE Developer and GATE Embedded to develop your application.
Of course, you are free to use any other (IE) tool as well.
You can use a rule-based or a machine learning approach or combinations thereof.
We provide you with a training corpus of 400 documents.
The corpus is annotated with CFP annotations and GATE annotations.
You should think about splitting the corpus for training and testing purposes.
Submit your source code plus a corresponding executable file (JAR, bin, ...) incl. all dependencies.
In other words, your submission has to be self-contained!
Also include howto run instructions as an additional plaintext README and a short report (PDF) about the modules you used and developed, any problems you encountered, and a description of your evaluation.

Deliverable is a Zip archive to be uploaded via TUWEL, containing all relevant project files! Any questions and discussions are very welcome in the TUWEL forum.
