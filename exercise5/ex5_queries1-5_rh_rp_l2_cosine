The Ranking for the 

1. Jazz/01 Chasing Pirates.mp3, RH, Cosine Metric
1	Electro/12 Feel Alive (Fuzzy Hair Vocal Mix).mp3	0.5712
		"Feel Alive" has slightly higher bpm (beats per minutes) than the query song. The query song is a fusion of the genres Jazz and Pop with a few Electro elements in it. The use of a synthesizer and the dominant use of the drums in the query song explains, why an Electro songs scored the highest similary. The tone pitch is similar to the query song. Although the bass and drums are very dominant, there are parts where the music are "softer". There is also a high melody line, which is similar to the query song. All in all there is high similarity to the query song according to the Metric and Feature Set, but from the human point of view there are just a few simililarities between these two songs. They are from different genres, but due to the fusion of different genres in the query song the songs are a little similar. 
2	Electro/05 Love Is Gonna Save Us (Remix 2007).mp3	0.5934	
		The second best score is also sung by an female artist. A synthesizer is also used to create the similar high melodies as in the query song. The vocals are in a similar frequency range as the vocals from the query song. Rhythm is faster than the best song and there are also "soft" parts in the song, where the drums and bassline is less dominant. 
3	Electro/07 Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites - Kaskade Remix.mp3	0.6439	
		The rythm is closer to the query song than the best song, but there are no vocals except for some reappearing phrases. 
4	Electro/02 Stop Go.mp3	0.6536	
		The bpm is higher than the query song, there is a very dominant melody line in the song. There is more variety in the song than the songs before. The drums are more dominant compared to the query song. 
5	Electro/14 Every Single Day.mp3	0.6845	
6	Jazz/09 Paradise.mp3	0.6851	
		The first Jazz song in this listing. Although it's only on the 6th position, there is much more similarity to the query song, than the songs before. The bpms are nearly the same (the query song is slightly slower) and the female singer has a deeper and darker voice than the singer from the query song, but a human would consider this song very similar to the query song.
7	Electro/Chain Smoker.mp3	0.6879	
		Very prominent bass and drum line, and higher bpm than the query song. No vocals and no use of a high melodies as in the query song. This song is not similar to the query song and should be ranked much lower.
8	Electro/09 Satisfaction (B.Deep Remix).mp3	0.6949	
		Very few vocals and very "electronic", with hard beats and low basses. Not similar to the query song at all. 
9	Jazz/15 Cherish The Day.mp3	0.6977	
		This song has more high frequencies than the query song. No bass is used and the bass is also high pitched. It's similar to the query song.
10	Electro/06 Who's Your Daddy (Fuzzy Hair Remix).mp3	0.699
		not similar 
20	Electro/02 Get Better (Sfaction Reloaded Mix).mp3	0.7227	
		not similar
30	Hip Hop/08 World Town.mp3	0.7349	
		The vocals are much higher. Many high frequencies due to use of some exotic trompets. No similarity.
40	Hip Hop/Final Frontier Ft. Blueprint.mp3	0.75	
		no similarity
50	Hip Hop/09 The Turn.mp3	0.7651	
		Many bongos and drums, but the vocals are in a similar frequency range as the vocals from the query song. 
60	Hip Hop/08 No Sleep Till Brooklyn.mp3	0.7754	
		absolutely no similarity at all
70	Jazz/04 Young Blood.mp3	0.7857	
		Although this is a song from the same artist it is ranked this low. I would ranked it much higher, since the drums and bass sounds very similar to the query song. The vocals are very similar, but the tempo of the song is different. The song in generals seems more "lively" than the query song, that might be a reason it is ranked this low. 
80	Jazz/11 One Flight Down.mp3	0.7923	
		Piano, Drums, Violin, Jazz-Guitars and a Upright Bass are used in this song. Although it's the same artist, the genre is different. This song "jazzier" than the query song. Because of the "melodic" instruments, there are a very high part of high frequencies in this song. 
90	Heavy Metal/03 Danger Line.mp3	0.7996	
		no similarity at all
100	Hip Hop/01 Headlines.mp3	0.8039	
		The vocals are nearly constantly present and the singer is male with a much lower voice. The bpm is much faster than the query song. no similarity at all.

1. Jazz/01 Chasing Pirates.mp3, RH, L2 Metric
1	Jazz/02 Hang On To Your Love.mp3	756.6417
		This song is very similar to the query song. The rythm is very alike and the bass and drums sound similar. It's the same genre. There is a much higher high frequency part in the song, but to a human listener this songs sound very alike to the query song. The Metric worked very well here.
2	Hip Hop/05 1000 Kisses  & jada.mp3	861.0555
		The second best song is not very similar. There are two singers, the genre is different and the vocals are much more prominent than the first song. 	
3	Hip Hop/07 Intergalactic.mp3	897.524	
		Except for the related rythms there is no resemblance for the human ear. Different genre, Rap, robotic voice and a lot of mixed noises. 
4	Jazz/05 Bull Rider.mp3	987.3795	
		This song is a fusion between Jazz and Country. The style is very close to the query song. The vocals are higher and there are less prominent drums and bass.

6	Jazz/04 Chameleon (Edit).mp3	1152.391

		very "jazzy" and "soft/smooth", very alike but with nearly no drums at all.	
8	Electro/06 Whiskers.mp3	1166.5624	
		this song should be ranked much lower. the used pitched are related, but the whole song is very different from the query song.
9	Hip Hop/01 Marvins Room.mp3	1210.8524	
		although it's Hip Hop, there is a small resemblace here. The vocals are very smooth (although it's male) similar to vocals in the query song. 
10	Jazz/05 I Wouldn't Need You.mp3	1221.4465
		I personally would place this song as the Top Song. Same (fusion-)genre, same singer, same album, similar instruments. Only difference is that it's in a different key. This song has long solo parts, where there is only instruments playing. That might be a reason why this song scored this low.
20	Jazz/15 Creepin' In.mp3	1363.003
		Very "country-ish". Long solo parts of a Resonator Guitar. Same singer, but very different style. 
30	Jazz/08 You've Ruined Me.mp3	1395.9739	
		This song should scored much better. It is very similar to the query song, but the pitchs are not alike. Also there are a lot of mixed melodies. All in all this song shouldn't below previous songs.
40	Jazz/05 St. Louis Blues (with Stevie Wonder).mp3	1425.0432	
		it's jazz, but not similar to the query song. Very differnt style.
