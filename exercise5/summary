The differences between the RH and the RP are very little. They both retrieve songs from the same genres with a very high similarity, but the RH perfomed even better when it comes to exclude non-alike songs at the lower ranks. RP seems to low-rank songs that are more similar to the query that songs that are higher ranked. 

The biggest difference is betweent the cosine and L2 metric. L2 performs much better than cosine ranking. The distance range are very small and the results are very poor. The Electro genre seems to always very high in many songs, even it's a completely different genre. 

The RH feature set in combination with L2 seems to produce the most useful results. It captures our perception of similarity the best for Classic and Heavy Metal. Those are probably the genres that are the most different from the other genres and therefore they are easier to recognize by the algorithm. Genres like Hip Hop, Electro and Jazz seems to have more resemblance. Songs like "Chasing Pirates" by Norah Jones seems not to match well. The reason therefor is, that the genre of this particular song is not easy to distinguish. It is a fusion of the genres Jazz and Pop with a few Electro elements. The use of synthesizer is very prominent and not representative for songs of this genre. That's why it show resemblance with songs from the genre Hip Hop and even Electro.
