Information Retrieval
=====================

Exercise 1
----------

See README.md in `exercise1/` directory.


Exercise 2
----------

See README.md in `exercise2/` directory. It depends on exercise 1, so the indexer has to be executed from there, while the retrieval must be done from the `exercise2/` directory.
